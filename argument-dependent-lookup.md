# argument-dependent-lookup

Argument Dependent Lookup (or Koenig Lookup) is a concept that allows
the C++ compiler to look for certain functions in certain namespaces,
even though those functions were not referred to with their fully
qualified names. Basically, **if you call a function** foo(argument), the
**compiler will not only look** for free non-member non-friend functions
“foo” **in the current namespace**, **but also in the namespace of the type of
the argument, if it differs from the current one**. For example, the type
of the argument may be Foo::bar (in namespace Foo), then the compiler
will look for a (possibly) better-matching function foo in the namespace
Foo, even though it was not asked for it. ADL enables this simple
program:

#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, const char* argv[])

{

     std::cout << “Hello World!”;

}

Here, << is std::operator<<(std::ostream&, <something>), a free function
defined in the namespace std. Without ADL, you would have to call it
explicitly like so:

std::operator<<(std::cout, “Hello World");

But ADL will look for such a function in the std namespace, because one
of its arguments — std::cout — is _always_ a member of that namespace
(the other may be, too). Another example:

```
namespace ADL
{
    struct Container
    {
        int* begin()
        {
            print::ln("!");
            return array;
        }
        int array [5];
    };
 }

int main(int argc, const char* argv[])
 {
    // Enable ADL!
    using std::begin;
    ADL::Container c;
    // Prints "!", even though we're not calling ADL::begin()!
    begin(c);

}
```
