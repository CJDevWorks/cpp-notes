# abstract-classes-without-pure-virtual-methods


If you want a class without pure virtual functions to be solely an abstract class,

make the destructor pure virtual:

class Base
{
public:
     void do(){ }
     virtual ~Base() = 0;
};

I.e.: you want a base class for inheritance/polymorphism but don't want
the base class to be instantiateable.  That way, giving it a pure virtual function makes
it an abstract class.

- Do you need to implement its destructor ??
However, you must implement that destructor somewhere, as the compiler
will call it when a derived class’ destructor is called. 

- Can that be private??
  No. Derived destructor cant access.
