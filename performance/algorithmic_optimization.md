Algorithmic optimization. In bottlenecks, optimization techniques substantially independent
from the programming language and totally independent from the platform are
applied. They are the techniques that can be found in algorithm theory textbooks. This
optimization consists in attempting to decrease the number of the executed machine
instructions, and, in particular, the number of the calls to costly routines, or to transform
the expensive instructions to equivalent but less costly instructions. For example, the
quick sort8 sorting algorithm is chosen instead of the selection sort9 algorithm. If this
optimization makes the program fast enough, the optimization stage is complete.
