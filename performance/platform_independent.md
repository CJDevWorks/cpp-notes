Platform independent optimization. In bottlenecks, optimization techniques that are
dependent on the programming language and its standard library, but independent both
on the software platform and on the hardware platform are applied. For example, in operations are used instead of floating point operations, or the more appropriate container
                                                                                   class is chosen among the ones available in the standard library. If this makes the program
