Software platform dependent optimization. In bottlenecks, optimization techniques
that are dependent both on the programming language and on the software platform,
but independent on the hardware platform are applied. For example, compiler options,
pragma compiler directives, language extensions, non-standard libraries, direct calls
to the operating system are exploited. If this makes the program fast enough, the
optimization stage is complete.
